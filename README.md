REDUX-CHALLENGE

- This is a WORK IN PROGRESS.
- This app is in response to a challenge in Udacity's React nanodegree.
- The Application is meant to showcase using redux to handle the management and rendering of posts and comments
- The challenge was to make an application that allowed anyone to make a post that was relevant to one of three categories.
- Each post has the ability to be up or downvoted, add comments to, modified and be deleted.
- Deleted posts, will still exist, but not be rendered, so that comments in response to the post will still exist.
- Comments can be voted on, modified and deleted as well.
